Pirates Revenge is a fun, hack'n'slash adventure revolving around a pirate trying to save a princess.

The game starts without much fanfare, as you must quickly learn the ropes of being a pirate to accomplish the gargantuan task of saving the princess from the treacherous band of skeleton pirates. Learn how to wield your sword and shotgun with ease as you make your way through the levels.

The skeleton pirates prove to be quite the handful, as they have taken the princess away to a very far island, and you must go island-hopping and clear their hordes of minions to pass through. It is no easy feat to accomplish, but your pirate skills will help you throughout the adventure.

With the trusty guidance of your pirate map, you will nagivate the high seas and surpass each obstacle to get to your goal. On the last island awaits the dreaded skeletal pirate king holding the princess hostage. It is there that you must go, and rescue her.

Pirates Revenge is one of my most loved games that I have created, so I appreciate you playing it and enjoying it as much as I have!
